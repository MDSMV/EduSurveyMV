# EduSurveyMV

The primary purpose of the Education Survey of Maldives (ESM) is to provide a comprehensive snapshot of both the satisfaction and utilization of education in the Maldives. The main objectives of the study includes: 

- Providing the first national portrait of the satisfaction level of education for the full spectrum of education, including students, households and providers from all accessible corners of Maldives.
- Identifying education and school-age needs and preferences among students and households in the Maldives with students as they pertain to supporting both the employment of parents and the development of children.
- Capturing data on all forms of care for all children in a household and education providers.
- Providing the perspectives of students, families and providers on the services offered in a system.
- Linking the data set collected with policy-relevant data.
- Increasing the understanding of the education received by low-income families and how that varies across communities. 

The ESM is a set of four integrated, nationally representative surveys. 

These will be surveys of 1) student-based, 2) household/home-based 3) center-based, and 4) the workforce-based. Together they characterize the supply of and demand of education in the Maldives and permit better understanding of how well students' and families’ needs and preferences coordinate with providers’ offerings and constraints. 

The study is planned, designed and conducted by Maldives Digital Society (MDS), as well as other collaborating individuals and organizations.
